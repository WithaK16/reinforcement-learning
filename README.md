### Overview

This repository is a fork from https://github.com/dennybritz/reinforcement-learning where I (try at least !) implement my own version of Reinforcement Learning algorithm.

A lot more information about the why and how of this project at the original repo: https://github.com/dennybritz/reinforcement-learning

Infinite thanks for all the curation work done by Denny Britz and by providing every solution. It's an amazing source for learning Reinforcement learning.
